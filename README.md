# Football Strategy Analysis ⚽
# Project Overview
This project delves into football strategy analysis using Power BI and Python to uncover patterns and trends in game strategy. The analysis provides insights into various on-field actions, such as punts, passes, antecedents, and other critical football maneuvers.

# Key Insights and Findings
1. Punt Analysis 📊
Observed fluctuations in punt counts across specific dates, highlighting strategic patterns in punt usage.
2. Pass Analysis 📊
Identified significant variations in pass counts, with peaks reaching up to 1.17K on key days.
3. Antecedent & Unit State 🔍
Analyzed the average antecedent across unit states, noting distinct trends in 'golden' and 'finalized' states.
4. Trusted Judgments & Unit ID 💡
Found a high average of 831.01M trusted judgments and an average unit ID of 6.11, useful for understanding decision consistency.
5. Action Analysis 📈
Examined actions like field goals, kneeling, passing, punting, and running:
Field Goal Confidence: Confidence values ranged from 0.62 to 1.00, with an average of 0.76, providing insights into reliability for field goal attempts.
# Key Takeaways
Through this project, we gain a data-driven perspective on football strategies, enabling more informed decisions. With Python for data processing and Power BI for visualization, the analysis presents clear insights for refining football strategies.

# Technology Used
